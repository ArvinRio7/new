          When the days are cold
          And the cards all fold
          And the saints we see                   
          Are all made of gold
          When your dreams all fail                   
          the ones we hail 
          Are the worst of all
          And the blood's run stale;
          When you feel my heat
          Look into my eyes 
          It's where my demons hide 
          It's where my demons hide 
          Don't get too close 
         It's dark inside
          It's where my demons hide 
          It's where my demons hide                
          At the curtain's call 
          It's the last of all 
         All the sinners crawl 
          So they dug your grave 
          And the masquerade
          Will come calling out 
          t the mess you've made
          Don't wanna let you down
          But I am hell-bound
          Though this is all for you
          Don't wanna hide the truth
          No matter what we breed 
          We still are made of greed
          This is my kingdom come 
          This is my kingdom come
          When you feel my heat
          Look into my eyes
          It's where my demons hide 
          It's where my demons hide                  
          Don't get too close 
          It's dark inside
          It's where my demons hide 
          It's where my demons hide 
          They say it's what you make
          I say it's up to fate 
          It's woven in my soul 
          I need to let you go 
          Your eyes, they shine so bright 
          I wanna save that light 
          I can't escape this now 
       Unless you show me how 
          When you feel my heat 
          Look into my eyes 
          It's where my demons hide 
          It's where my demons hide                  
          Don't get too close 
          It's dark inside
          It's where my demons hide
          It's where my demons hide
